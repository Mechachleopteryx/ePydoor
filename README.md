In this repository are included the supplementary figures and tables provided in the article (/Supp_information)

Additionally, we include the scripts necesary to obtain the epitope discovery from splicing changes.

The pipeline is divided in 4 parts, depending the event type the user wants to obtain:

   * Pseudoexons (Exonizations)
   * New exons skipping events (Neoskipping)
   * Alternative splice site (A5_A3)
   * Intron retention (IR)
   
The user must run each of the 3 parts sequentially. The scripts are ready to be run in a slurm cluster. Until all jobs generated by a part are finished do not run the following part.

For any query related with the tool, please create an issue in the repository.
